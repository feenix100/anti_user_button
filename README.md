# Button Created by Open AI Chat GPT
button.html - open in a browser to check out this implementation of a very high speed button using javascript.

I also created a version that can be used in a microsoft excel spreadsheet, just for fun. 

There are code snippets for a few other languages that should produce the same result.

The python script displays a button in a window that can never be clicked on because it will move out of the way constantly.
"keeps an idiot entertained for hours"

this is a python script I created using Open Ai chat gpt.
i spent a few hours chatting with chat gpt before it spit out the final script...
code is completely generated by chat gpt 3.5
